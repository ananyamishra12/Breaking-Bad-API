# Breaking-Bad-Api

React project that uses the [breaking bad api](https://breakingbadapi.com/documentation) to show and filter characters from the show.

When you hover over the cards you can see their details such as 

 - Name 
 - Nickname
 - Birthday 
 - Status by the end of the show(dead or alive)



Apart from that you can also search for any character.
